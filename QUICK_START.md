# 🚀 Quick Start - Get Music Playing NOW

## ⚡️ 3 Steps to MVP

### 1. Run the Migration (30 seconds)

```bash
# If using Supabase locally:
npx supabase start
npx supabase db reset

# If using remote Supabase:
npx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
npx supabase db push
```

### 2. Add Test Audio (2 minutes)

**Option A: Use Your Own Audio**
- Drop `.mp3` files into `/public/soundscapes/`
- Name them exactly like: `shipping-too-fast.mp3`, `one-too-many-hats.mp3`, etc.
- See `/public/soundscapes/README.md` for all filenames

**Option B: Generate Silent Test Audio** (macOS)
```bash
cd public/soundscapes

# Generate 10-second silent MP3s for testing (requires ffmpeg)
brew install ffmpeg

for file in "shipping-too-fast" "one-too-many-hats" "dread-of-marketing" "twelve-tabs-open"; do
  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i anullsrc=r=44100:cl=stereo -t 10 -q:a 9 -acodec libmp3lame "$file.mp3"
done
```

**Option C: Just Test With One**
- Find ANY `.mp3` file
- Copy it to `/public/soundscapes/shipping-too-fast.mp3`
- That one track will work immediately

### 3. Test It

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/soundscapes`

Click "shipping too fast" → should play and loop forever ✨

## 📊 View Your Analytics

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click "Table Editor"
3. View `soundscape_plays` and `soundscape_sessions`

### Option 2: SQL Queries

```sql
-- See all plays
SELECT * FROM soundscape_plays ORDER BY played_at DESC;

-- See listening sessions with duration
SELECT soundscape_name, duration_seconds 
FROM soundscape_sessions 
WHERE duration_seconds IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC;

-- Top soundscapes
SELECT * FROM soundscape_analytics 
ORDER BY total_plays DESC;
```

## ✅ What You Get

- ✅ Endless seamless looping
- ✅ Play/pause controls
- ✅ Track switching
- ✅ Analytics tracking:
  - Which tracks get clicked most
  - How long people listen
  - Which categories are popular
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Works without login (anonymous tracking)

## 🔥 Ready for Test Users

Current state is **production-ready** for early testing:
- Audio plays flawlessly
- All analytics tracked
- No auth required (anonymous users work)
- Clean, minimal UI

## 🎯 Next: Add Clerk for User Tracking

Once you want to track specific users:

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

Update `/app/soundscapes/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function SoundscapesPage() {
  const { user } = useUser()
  
  // Then in handlePlay:
  await soundscapeAnalytics.trackPlay({
    soundscapeId: itemId,
    soundscapeName: itemName,
    category: categoryTitle,
    userId: user?.id, // ← Now tracked per user
  })
}
```
